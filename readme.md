# Isogenic Game Engine
HTML5 2D and isometric game engine.

## Installation
If you have the premium (paid for) version of the engine please read this:

After downloading or cloning this repository, if you plan to use the multiplayer aspects of the engine you should run
(assumes that you cloned / extracted the engine repository to /ige)**:

    cd /ige/server
    npm install

This will automatically download and install any required Node.js modules.

** You must have Node.js installed for the installation to work and the engine's multiplayer / networking system is only
included in the premium licensed version of the engine and is not part of the "prototype" version (the free one).

## About This Version
The engine is released under strict confidentiality and must not be shared with anyone who does not also have a
license. Please remember that you should not place an unobfuscated copy of the engine or any part of it on an
internet-accessible server. A packager system is included with the engine to allow you to deploy your project including
the parts of the engine you are using into a single obfuscated / minified file.

## Examples
There are a lot of examples in the ./examples folder. Please see the ./examples/readme.md file for more information
about running the examples.
