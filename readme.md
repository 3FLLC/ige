# Isogenic Game Engine
HTML5 2D and isometric game engine version 1.1.0. This is a pre-release version of the engine. It is released under
strict confidentiality and must not be shared with anyone. You are granted a license to use this pre-release version
for your own internal testing and development work but no work generated using this version must be released until a
generally available launch of 1.1.0 or you obtain permission from Irrelon Software to do so.

Whilst we are classing this as a pre-release version, it is very stable and the best version of the engine to build
new game projects with. Two production games have already shipped using this version from third-party developers.
Feedback about this version of the engine has been overwhelmingly positive and based on user response it is the easiest
and most feature-rich version to date.

If you have any comments, questions, requests, concerns etc please don't hesitate to discuss them on the GitHub issue
tracker for this project: https://github.com/coolbloke1324/ige/issues

You can also get live support from the developer via Skype: coolbloke1324
